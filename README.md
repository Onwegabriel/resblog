# Resblog - A Personal Blog Website

## Overview

**Resblog** is a full-stack web application that I developed as a personal project to create, manage, and share blog posts. The project was built using a combination of modern web technologies to provide a user-friendly and engaging experience for both writers and readers.

The main features of Blogify include:

- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionality.
- **Create and Manage Posts:** Authenticated users can write, edit, and delete their own blog posts.
- **Responsive Design:** A mobile-friendly and responsive layout to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.
- **Comment System:** Readers can leave comments on blog posts, encouraging interaction and discussion.
- **Categories and Tags:** Organize blog posts into categories and tag them for easier navigation and discovery.
- **Search Functionality:** A search bar allows users to quickly find articles based on keywords.
- **User Profiles:** Personal user profiles showcasing their published posts.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Built using **React**, utilizing modern libraries like **React Router** for navigation and **React Context API** for state management.
- **Backend:** Developed with **PHP** to handle user authentication, manage blog post data, and interact with the **MySQL** database.
- **Database:** Utilized **MySQL** to store user information, blog posts, comments, and more.
- **Styling:** Styled using **CSS** with a focus on clean design and responsive layouts.
- **Deployment:** Deployed the frontend on **Netlify** and the backend on **Heroku**, allowing for a seamless user experience.
